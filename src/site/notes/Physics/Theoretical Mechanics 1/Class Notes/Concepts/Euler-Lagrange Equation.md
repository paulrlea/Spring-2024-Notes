The Euler-Lagrange equation is the cornerstone of [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/2024-01-23 Lagrangian Mechanics\|2024-01-23 Lagrangian Mechanics]]. 
It is given by 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial \dot{x} }  - \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial x }  = 0
$$
Where $L$ represents the [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Lagrangian\|Lagrangian]] and the arbitrary variable on the bottom can be any variable of motion within the system of coordinates you are working in, including [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Cartesian Coordinates\|Cartesian Coordinates]], [[Physics/Math Background/Polar Coordinates\|Polar Coordinates]], [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Cylindrical Coordinates\|Cylindrical Coordinates]] or [[Physics/Math Background/Spherical Coordinates\|Spherical Coordinates]]
