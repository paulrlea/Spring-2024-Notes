The [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Lagrangian\|Lagrangian]] is defined as:
$$
L = T-U
$$
Where T is the kinetic energy, and U is the potential energy. 
$$
L = L(x,\dot{x},t)
$$
It is a function of position, velocity and time. It is used in the [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Euler-Lagrange Equation\|Euler-Lagrange Equation]] and [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics 1/Class Notes/Concepts/Lagrangian Mechanics\|Lagrangian Mechanics]].
