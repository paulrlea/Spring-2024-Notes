Recall: an inertial reference frame is at rest or moves with a constant velocity & newtons laws are valid

	- Rotating Reference frame
		- WWII Artillerymen had to account for the spin of the earth to accurately hit their targets

Rotating coordinate systems: 
Example: Rotating reference frame on earth compared to stationary reference frame
