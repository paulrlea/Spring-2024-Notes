The  Lorentz Gauge is defined as the following 
$$
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{A} = \frac{1}{c^{2}} \frac{ \partial V }{ \partial t } 
$$
In direct opposition to the [[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Coulomb Gauge\|Coulomb Gauge]], the Lorentz Gauge is utilized in [[Electrodynamics\|Electrodynamics]] as opposed to [[Electrostatics\|Electrostatics]]. 

Applying the Lorentz gauge yields the inhomogenous wave equation for the combined maxwell law thing in [[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Lecture Notes/2024-04-4 The Potential Formulation\|2024-04-4 The Potential Formulation]]

What is a gauge? 
- A function introduced into a field equation to produce a convenient form of equation but having no observable physical consequences. 
- Important property of gauge transformations is that the electric and magnetic potentials must be gauge invariant.
