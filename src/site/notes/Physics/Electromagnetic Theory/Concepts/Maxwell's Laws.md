Encompasses 4 primary laws. 
[[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Ampere-Maxwell Law\|Ampere-Maxwell Law]]
[[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Gauss' Law\|Gauss' Law]]
[[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Gauss' Law for magnetic field\|Gauss' Law for magnetic field]]
[[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Concepts/Faraday's Law\|Faraday's Law]]

All of non-relativistic electromagnetism can be derived from these 4 laws, except for some specific material properties. 

Also see differential form of these laws.
