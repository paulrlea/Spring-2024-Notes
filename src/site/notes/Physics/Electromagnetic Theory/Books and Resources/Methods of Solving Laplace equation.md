In this class we go over the following methods: 
- Solving both Laplace and Poisson's Equation via direct integration
	- See [[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Lecture Notes/Electrostatics/2024-01-25 Laplace Via Direct Integration\|2024-01-25 Laplace Via Direct Integration]]
- Solving Laplace's Equation via Image charges and Multi-pole Expansion
	- See [[Physics/Electromagnetic Theory/Lecture Notes/Electrostatics/2024-01-29 Method of image charges\|2024-01-29 Method of image charges]] and [[Class 9 Multipole Expansion 020824.pdf]]
- Solving Poisson's Equation via Spherical and Cartesian Coordinates.
