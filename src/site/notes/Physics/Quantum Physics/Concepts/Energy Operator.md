We can try and understand the [[Physics/Quantum Physics/Concepts/Energy Operator\|Energy Operator]] through the example of the [[Physics/Quantum Physics/Concepts/Infinite square well\|Infinite square well]]. The basis vector, which is also the solution to the [[Physics/Quantum Physics/Concepts/Schrodinger equation\|Schrodinger equation]] for this is given by:
$$
\varphi_{n}(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L}\ }sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
$$
Where the [[Physics/Quantum Physics/Concepts/Schrodinger equation\|Schrodinger equation]] is then
$$
\left[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + V(x) \right]\varphi(x) = E\varphi(x)
$$
The content within brackets, $\left[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + V(x) \right]$, constitutes the [[Physics/Quantum Physics/Concepts/Energy Operator\|Energy Operator]], also denoted by $\hat{H}$.
