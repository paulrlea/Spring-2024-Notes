Example of problem that would be nearly impossible to solve with newtonian mechanics

#### Lagrange's equation of motion 
aka [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics/Class Notes/Concepts/Euler-Lagrange Equation\|Euler-Lagrange Equation]]
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial \dot{x} } - \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial x }  = 0
$$
5 simple steps to Lagrangian mechanics 
1. Find the kinetic energy (T)
	$T = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
2. Find the potential energy 
	$U=mgh$ for gravity
3. Calculate [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics/Class Notes/Concepts/Lagrangian\|Lagrangian]]
	$L = T-U$
4. Calculate [[Physics/Theoretical Mechanics/Class Notes/Concepts/Euler-Lagrange Equation\|Euler-Lagrange Equation]]
	$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{ \partial L }{ \partial \dot{x} }-\frac{ \partial L }{ \partial x }=0$
5. Solve Diff. eq (optional)
